Symfony blog 
========================

The "Symfony blog app" is a reference application created to show how
to develop applications following the [Symfony Best Practices][1].

Requirements
------------

  * PDO-MYSQL PHP extension enabled;
 

Installation
------------

download a  project with this command:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Anse-dev/project_simple-blog-mvc_symfony.git
```

After downloaded, you can install  the dependence :

```bash
$ composer install
```

Usage
-----

There's no need to configure anything to run the application. If you have
[installed Symfony][4] binary, run this command:

```bash
$ cd my_project/
$ symfony serve
```

Then access the application in your browser at the given URL (<https://localhost:8000> by default).

If you don't have the Symfony binary installed, run `php -S localhost:8000 -t public/`
to use the built-in PHP web server or [configure a web server][3] like Nginx or
Apache to run the application.
